      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Toronto is the capital city of the Canadian province of Ontario. Its
          current area is 630.20 ùëòùëö2 (243.3 square mile). With a recorded
          population of 2,731,571 in 2016, it is the most populous city in
          Canada and the fourth most populous city in North America. Toronto is
          a prominent centre for music, theatre, motion picture production, and
          television production, and is home to the headquarters of Canada's
          major national broadcast networks and media outlets. Its varied
          cultural institutions, which include numerous museums and galleries,
          festivals and public events, entertainment districts, national
          historic sites, and sports activities, attract over 43 million
          tourists each year.
          <br /><br />
          If you're one of those 43 million tourists, you might have many
          concerns when you visit Toronto. These concerns may include place to
          go, eat, sleep, shop and so on.
          <br /><br />
          This project aims to select top 10 restaurants in 8 boroughs(Downtown
          Toronto, West Toronto, East Toronto, Central Toronto, North York,
          Scarborough, East York, Etobicoke) of Toronto based on number of likes
          and rating restaurants from Foursquare. Foursquare is a local
          search-and-discovery mobile app developed by Foursquare Labs Inc. It
          also has web app and API.
        </p>

      <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>Data To discover restaurants of concern, following data are used:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Foursquare API : Forsquare API to get the most common restaurants of
            a given neighbourhood of a borough. It's in json format.
          </li>
          <li>
            Postal Code of Boroughs in Toronto : Postal code of neighbourhoods
            of a given borough in Toronto. This data can be obtained from
            wikipedia using Pandas. This data consist of Postal Code, Borough
            and Neighbourhood. It's in Tabular format.
          </li>
          <li>
            Neighbourhood Latitude and Longitude : Neighbourhood Latitude and
            Longitude of a given borough. Latitude and Longitude are used to
            obtain the most common restaurants in a given neighbourhood using
            Foursquare API. It can be found in Geospatial_Coordinates.csv. It's
            a csv file
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          The target is to retrieve top 10 restaurants in 8 boroughs of Toronto.
          That are Downtown Toronto, West Toronto, East Toronto, Central
          Toronto, North York, Scarborough, East York and Etobicoke.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h3>Technology Used</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Numpy: Scientific Computing libray for Python</li>
            <li>Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis</li>
            <li>Matplotlib: Visualization</li>
            <li>requests: API operations</li>
            <li>Nominatim: Convert location name to Latitude and Longitude</li>
            <li>folium: Visualize data on map</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h3>Data Extraction</h3>
        <p>
          First, I get postal codes in 8 boroughs of Toronto from
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M"
            >wikipedia page</a
          >
          using Pandas, and filter out <b>not assigned</b> column value. I use
          Pandas to read <b>geospatial goordinates</b> of toronto from
          <b>Geospatial_Coordinates.csv</b>. Then I join the postal codes with
          geospatial goordinates.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Here is what we have so far:</b>
          <img src="img/toronto nb latlong.PNG" alt="toronto nb latlong" />
        </p>

        <p>
          After that, I use Foursquare API to explore venues in each
          neighbourhood using latitude and longitude with the following
          endpoind:
          <code class="highlighter-rouge">
            https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?&client_id={}&client_secret={}&v={}&ll={},{}&radius={}&limit={}</code
          >.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>This is what we have get:</b>
          <img src="img/toronto_venues.PNG" alt="toronto venues" />
        </p>

        <p>
          So now, let's filter the data to keep <b>Venue Category</b> that are
          restaurants.
          <br />
          <img src="img/toronto_retaurants.PNG" alt="toronto retaurants" />
          <br />
        </p>

        <p>
          Next, let's use <b>Venue ID</b> for each restaurants to get their
          details with the following endpoind:
          <br />
          <code
            >https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/{}?&client_id={}&client_secret={}&v={}</code
          >.
          <br />
          I choose following column: Venue ID, Address, Phone Number, Likes,
          Rating, and Tips.
          <br />
          <br />
          <img src="img/restaurants_detail.PNG" alt="restaurants' detail" />
        </p>

        <p>
          We have restaurants' detail. Let's merge restaurants with their
          detail, base on Venue ID, to get information we need for restaurants
          in each neighbourhood.
          <br />
          <img
            src="img/toronto_restaurants_detail.PNG"
            alt="toronto Retaurants Detail"
          />
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, sort all restaurants in descending order and group them base
          on borough and take top 10 of them.
          <img src="img/top_10_restaurants.PNG" alt="top 10 restaurants" />
        </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          There is one thing that is needed to point out. From
          <b>10 top restaurants</b> above, there are just 65 restaurants. We have 8
          boroughs, and we are interested top 10 restaurants in each borough. This
          means that, base on Foursquare API, some boroughs have less than 10
          restaurants. When visualize results, I decide to call restaurants in
          boroughs with 10 or more restaurants <b>top 10 restaurants</b>. Beside
          this, let's just call them <b>top restaurants</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I start with bar chart. After bar chart, I create a visualization for
          all top/top 10 restaurants on the map using
          <b> Name, number of like and rating</b> of a given restaurant as a
          pop-up.

      <h2>Discussion</h2>

      <p>
        The purpose of this project is to find Top 10 Restauarants in 8 Boroughs of Toronto by Rating and Likes using Foursquare API. For some boroughs, there are less than 10 restaurants. This is a drawback.
        <br>
        <br>
        Toronto itself varies in culture. It attracts millions of people every year. Further analysis should be made.
        It would be interesting to use different API to explore more.
        <br>
        <br>
        Base on Foursquare API, although it is not complete, this might give us a pretty good idea of restaurants in Toronto and its boroughs. The reason is the data is based on people. 
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        Starting by introducing of problem, then describe needed data, walkthrough methodology, get the results,
        and finally the discussion of whether the project is helpful. I hope this gives help target audiens in deciding of choosing restaurants in each boroughs and Toronto overall.
      </p>

        <b>Future Work</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Try different API</li>
          <li>Discover top restaurants in different category (Italian, Japanese...)</li>
          <li>find out, overall, which borough has better restaurants (Likes and Rating) </li>
          <li>Examine tip(review) from user</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
